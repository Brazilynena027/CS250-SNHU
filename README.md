Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    User needs are the requirements that enhance a product or service for a user.  The user stories describe how features should work from the end users point of view. To do this it is a good idea to get the user involved in the process by helping the user to undertand their problems, what their goals are and what the processes and preferneces will be. To interpret these needs implimenting user stories  help to serve as a to do list  that keep the tasks organized and prioritized for implimentation.
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 
    There are two methodologies to dealing with developing programs. There is the waterfall method and the agile method. When chosing between these two method there are a few things to consider. Consider the size of the project, the methodology used will need to compliment the size for example, the larger the project, it is recommended that the agile methodolgy be considered due to its flexiblity.  Waterfall is organized project management method that is not very flexible. Budget is another thing to consider, with agile the budget is also flexible since changes can be implimented anywhere in the project. The processes i hope to incorporate into my future development work would be to welcome change into the developement. Sometimes going through the process and then discussing the progress made through the sprint meetings and getting the valuable feedback can give the product the requirement it needs. This gives the customer a more competitive advantage.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    A good team member contributes to the developement of the project through feedback and communication. Team memebers need to be engaged and fully aware of the goals of the project. Team memeber who will not critize other memebers but ideas.
